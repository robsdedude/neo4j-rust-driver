This is a work in progress.

Disclaimer:
 * While I'm currently affiliated with Neo4j, this is my private hobby project.
   It's not an officially supported piece of software by Neo4j.
 * This project is primarily meant for private studies.


Future Ideas:
 * Make it work in the first place ;)
 * `serde` support
